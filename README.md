# **Sentinel**
### _A real-time danger detector and community alert system_

**Sentinel** is a crowdsourced danger-detection app that helps users stay safe by showing nearby hazards on a live map.  
Users can **report**, **upvote**, or **downvote** danger spots — making the map smarter and more reliable over time.
